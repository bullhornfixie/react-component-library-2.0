# React Component Library 2.0 

## About 

As a freelance software engineer, I have to strike a daily balance between quality code and being cost effective. When building web apps, I am building custom components in React which can ultimately be used on a variety of projects. Rather than re-inventing the wheel on each project or having to sift through old projects to find a component I had built previously, I consolidated these common components into a centralised library.
